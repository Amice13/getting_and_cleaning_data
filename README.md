### Getting and Cleaning Data

This is an R script developed as the course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data" by John Hopkins Bloomberg University.
It does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

Appropriate data can be found here:

### How to use script

1. Put the script in the folder with data ("UCI HAR Dataset").
2. Set this folder as working directory in R or R-Studio.
3. Run the script.
4. Collect "tidy.csv" and "tidy2.csv" files with tidy data.
5. Perform any analysis you want.

Good luck!
